### Datasets
I have used Kaggle's [EMÄ°RHAN BULUT](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanai/age-and-sex-prediction-by-artificial-intelligence) which has used  [UTKFace](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new) dataset. 

##### About Dataset
The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. The dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). Images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. Dataset could be used on a variety of tasks, e.g., face detection, age estimation, age progression/regression, landmark localization, etc.
